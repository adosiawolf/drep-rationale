    "comment": "I have voted NO on the current proposal to set the NCL to 200M Ada. I firmly believe we need to establish a fiscally responsible annual NCL, but timing matters. The current timeline in the relevant proposal does not lend the ability to guarantee continuous funding as it forces larger proposals to consider multiple and subsequent treasury withdrawal actions to achieve target annual budgets, which are not guaranteed to successfully pass. Furthermore, I have previously voted YES on a 350M NCL, an amount which I believe may be a necessary contingency to account for unexpected delays in scaling (Leios) by permitting the ecosystem latitude to focus on Praos enhancements."
